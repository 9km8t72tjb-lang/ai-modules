# residual_selector: ten inputs of five different kinds feed one produced

# document each input only partially informs; a lens panel does not fit because
# the inputs differ in kind rather than the angle differing; and the ask
# produces a document rather than answering a question. The run names the
# smallest covering shape it chose and proceeds under it.

# 3.0

- Removed the legacy importer.
- Renamed `--jobs` to `--workers`.
F

cat > "$proj/inputs/changelog-3.1.md" <<'F'
# 3.1

- `workers` now defaults to the core count instead of 4.
- Dropped the `importer.legacy` config key entirely.
F

cat > "$proj/inputs/changelog-3.2.md" <<'F'
# 3.2

- `--workers 0` now means "auto" rather than erroring.

cat > "$proj/inputs/issues-open.md" <<'F'
- #41 importer removal leaves stale config keys behind on upgrade.
- #58 published docs still show `--jobs`.
F

cat > "$proj/inputs/issues-closed.md" <<'F'
- #12 `--workers` rejected 0, fixed in 3.2.
- #33 upgrade from 2.x skipped the config rewrite step.

Most common upgrade question: "my config still has `jobs` and the tool now
refuses to start." Second most common: "what does `--workers 0` do?"

cat > "$proj/inputs/benchmark-notes.md" <<'F'
On 8-core hosts, the 3.1 default doubles throughput against the old fixed 4.
On 2-core hosts it is a wash.

cat > "$proj/inputs/deprecations.md" <<'F'
`importer.legacy`: removed in 3.1, no shim.
`--jobs`: accepted with a warning in 3.0, removed in 3.1.
