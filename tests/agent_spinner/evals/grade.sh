#!/usr/bin/env bash
# grade.sh — deterministic grader for agent_spinner behavioral evals.
#
# Usage:
#   grade.sh <eval_id> <sandbox_proj> [response.txt]
#
# Every eval is graded on two axes. The filesystem axis reads the staged hash
# inventories, the run's roster file, and the briefs the run wrote before
# dispatch: those are facts the run left behind, not claims it made about
# itself. The response axis checks the markers the skill's own contract
# obliges, with wraps collapsed and negated sentences dropped, so a phrasing
# difference does not read as a regression.
#
# Signals and why each eval uses the one it does: evals/README.md.
