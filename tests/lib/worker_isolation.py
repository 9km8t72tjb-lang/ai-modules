"""Isolate a worker or a judge from the host's standing-instruction files.

Each worker and each judge stays free of the host's standing-instruction
files that its working directory and ancestor walk would reach, because it
runs under a fresh root outside the home directory and any git repository.

Cursor is the preferred measurement vendor. The Claude branch serves
compatibility runs and Claude-only product surfaces such as output-style loading.
Two Cursor sources stay outside this helper. User Rules stay outside it,
because Cursor keeps them in its settings rather than in project files.
The other source outside it is deployed user-level skills.

The Claude inheritance evidence is `### Configuration roots` and
`### Standing instruction files` on `wiki/entities/anthropic-claude-code.md`,
and `### A worker inherits the host's instructions unless it is isolated`
on `wiki/concepts/verification-surfaces.md`.
