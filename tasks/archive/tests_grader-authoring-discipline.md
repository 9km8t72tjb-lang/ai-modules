# Grader-authoring discipline for the local eval harnesses

## Goal

An eval grader fails only when the behaviour under test is genuinely wrong. The
rules that make that true are written where a future author reads them: the
durable authoring rule lands in the repo's testing guardrail and in the
versioned standing instructions that load at inference time, and the harness
mechanics land in the tests tree beside the runners they govern. A grader
written against these rules distinguishes a real regression from a correct answer
phrased differently, and a failing eval names which behaviour broke rather than
only that something did.

Four rules carry the work:

- **Assert substance, not surface form.** A check names the property that must
  hold, and passes on every phrasing and placement that satisfies it. Where a
  rubric permits two repair shapes, the check accepts both.
- **Anchor a structured match to its subject.** A check reading a structured
  report field matches the record whose subject is the item under test, since a
  bare name match also hits that name inside another record's prose.
- **Read prose with wraps collapsed.** A check matching more than one word reads
  the text with hard wraps removed, since a wrap falling mid-phrase makes a
  line-based match miss text that is present.
- **Split a long conjunction.** An eval asserting many independent behaviours
  reports per-behaviour results, so one slip localises instead of failing the
  whole eval and hiding what still holds.

## Context

The rules come from building the behavioural evals for
[the backlog-coherence pass](task-family_backlog-coherence-pass.md), where
grader defects outnumbered product defects and cost more runs than the feature
did. Five distinct grader bugs surfaced there, each of the shapes above: checks
that demanded one side of a valid two-sided repair, one that required a full
enumeration where the repo's own count-stable rule prefers a selector, one that
matched a task name inside a neighbouring record's evidence text, and one that
missed a phrase split across a hard wrap. Every one of them reported a working
behaviour as broken.

The conjunction rule comes from the same measurement. One eval carried its whole
scenario as a single pass/fail over many independent checks; individual checks
passed nearly always while the eval as a whole rarely did, and each run failed on
a different check. That signature reads as instability in the thing under test
when it is arithmetic.

Placement matters because of how each file is read. `TESTING.md` is the
family-consulted testing guardrail and already carries overlapping design
principles under `## Test Design Principles` (substance over wording, wraps
collapsed and negations dropped). The repo's standing instructions (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`) load at
inference time, so an agent authoring a new grader meets a short grader-authoring
pointer there without going looking. The tests tree is committed and reaches
every clone, but it is not auto-loaded, so a file under it is read only by
someone already working on the harness. The durable rule therefore has one
canonical home in `TESTING.md`, a compact inference-time pointer in the standing
instructions, and harness mechanics in `tests/README.md`.

Much of the mechanics already shipped in the two derived graders. Both carry
wrap-collapsed helpers (`unwrapped_file` / `unwrapped` / `label_window`),
subject-anchored structured match (`verdict_line` / subject-anchored why-open),
dual-shape acceptance on existing repair-shape checks (for example reconcile
`(a)` verify-or-follow and `(d)` enumeration-or-selector), subject-anchored
`verdict_line` / `verdict_is` on many structured-field checks, and per-check
PASS/FAIL reporting. What remains is aligning the durable four rules across
`TESTING.md` and the standing instructions, harness mechanics not yet recorded
in `tests/README.md`, wrap-use completeness across every multi-word check,
residual subject-anchoring in `fix_coherence` checks `(a)`, `(c)`, and `(e)`
that still bare-grep `^ *verdict:` lines then filter by task-name pattern rather
than `verdict_is`, and the still-false `task_create` label-structure needles
(evidence-phrased why-open; qualified lead-in; label-presence without a literal
`Open decision:`).

A second surface carries the same defect, measured on 2026-09-05 while running
this repo's eval sweep. The `task_create` eval grader checks an "Open decision:"
label by matching needles over the label window, and across five recorded runs of
its two labelled evals every failure but one landed on a needle rather than on a
missing part of the label. One run's label carried its why-open clause as "This
is the user's call ...; the evidence base does not settle it" and failed the
why-open check, whose needle list matches "left for the user" and "user-owned"
but neither of those phrasings. Two other runs enumerated two options as
`**Option A ...**` / `**Option B ...**` bullets and as `(a) ... (b) ...` and
failed the two-options check. The label-presence check has the same shape: it
counts the literal string `Open decision:`, so a run on 2026-09-05 whose body
carried `**Open decision (guardrail-bound):**` scored zero labels and failed as
though the agent had never surfaced the fork, when it had surfaced it and named
the ground the governing rule asks for. The same literal `"Open decision:"`
written/surfacing contract still appears in
`tests/task_create/evals/evals.json` expectations,
`tests/task_create/evals/README.md`, and the overview prose in
`tests/task_create/README.md` (the passage that says a genuinely open decision
is “written into the task as a labeled `Open decision:`”), so widening
`grade.sh` alone would leave those harness prose surfaces behind the needle
change. The grader's own comments
concede the tradeoff, saying a conformant clause phrased without either subject
marker would false-fail. The effect is that these evals report roughly a
one-in-five pass rate that reads as an unstable skill and is mostly grader
arithmetic, which is the same signature the conjunction rule above describes.

## Approach

1. **State the durable rule once in `TESTING.md`.** Rewrite
   `## Test Design Principles` in place so the four rules above sit there as the
   canonical authoring requirements. Keep the existing substance and wrap-collapse
   principles by extending them to the full four-rule set rather than leaving a
   second overlapping statement beside them. When rewriting wrap-collapse into
   the four-rule "Read prose with wraps collapsed" form, keep the standing
   "negations dropped" requirement with that rule or as its own sibling bullet.
   Preserve any principle already there that is not one of these four (for
   example filesystem-fact preference and fail-branch / sandbox staging) as
   sibling bullets.
2. **Point the standing instructions at that home.** Extend the
   `## Regression test harnesses` section of both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
   with a short grader-authoring pointer that names the four rules and cites
   `TESTING.md` `## Test Design Principles` as the canonical text, rather than
   restating the full rule bodies a second time. Keep the two standing files
   lockstep on this addition.
3. **State the mechanics in `tests/README.md`.** Record the harness-level detail
   there: property-named checks that accept every satisfying phrasing and
   placement, including dual repair shapes where the rubric permits them; the
   shared helper for wrap-collapsed matching; the subject-anchored form for
   structured-field checks; and the per-behaviour reporting shape. Point back
   at `TESTING.md` rather than restating the durable rule.
4. **Close the remaining gaps against the rules.** Walk the checks in the
   task-family eval grader and in the `task_create` eval grader and finish
   wrap-use completeness on every multi-word check; re-anchor every
   structured-report-field check that still matches a name anywhere on a
   `verdict:` line—including the `fix_coherence` either-side alter checks
   `(a)`, `(c)`, and `(e)`—through `verdict_is` or an either-side disjunction of
   `verdict_is`; and in the `task_create` harness rewrite in lockstep the
   label-structure needles in `tests/task_create/evals/grade.sh` and the
   written/surfacing contract in `tests/task_create/evals/evals.json`,
   `tests/task_create/evals/README.md`, and `tests/task_create/README.md`,
   re-deriving each from the still-false label forms already quoted in Context —
   an evidence-phrased why-open clause, a qualified lead-in such as
   `**Open decision (guardrail-bound):**`, and dual option enumerations such as
   `**Option A ...**` / `**Option B ...**` bullets or `(a) ... (b) ...` — so
   every surface describes a labeled open-decision lead-in by substance and each
   check names the part of the label that must be present and passes on every
   phrasing that carries it. A local run under
   `tests/task_create/evals/workspace/` may illustrate those forms; it is never
   the source for the needles or the written contract.

**Out of scope:**

- Consolidating or relocating any harness directory, which
  [the harness consolidation task](task-family_test-harness-consolidation.md)
  owns.
- Changing the trigger-eval runner or its harness, a separate surface this task
  does not touch.
- Authoring new scenarios or new coverage; this task changes how existing checks
  assert, not what is covered.

## Acceptance

1. `TESTING.md` `## Test Design Principles` states all four rules as the
   canonical grader-authoring requirements, and its prior overlapping substance
   and wrap-collapse wording is superseded rather than left beside a second copy.
   Principles already in that section that are not one of the four —
   filesystem-fact preference and fail-branch / sandbox staging — remain as
   sibling bullets beside the four rules. The standing "negations dropped"
   requirement remains with the wrap-collapse rule or as its own sibling bullet
   rather than being deleted by that supersession.
2. The `## Regression test harnesses` section of both `AGENTS.md` and
   `CLAUDE.md` carries the same short pointer that names the four rules and cites
   that `TESTING.md` section.
3. `tests/README.md` records the mechanics for each rule and cites `TESTING.md`
   rather than repeating the durable rule, so the surfaces do not drift.
4. The task-family and `task_create` eval graders each have a wrap-collapsing
   helper available to every check that matches more than one word, and each
   such check uses it.
5. Every structured-report-field check in those graders matches its record by
   subject, so a name appearing inside another record's prose cannot satisfy or
   defeat it. The `fix_coherence` either-side alter checks `(a)`, `(c)`, and
   `(e)` stay satisfied when the alter verdict lands on either named owner, via
   an either-side `verdict_is` disjunction.
6. Each label-structure check in `tests/task_create/evals/grade.sh` passes on the
   still-false forms already quoted in Context: a why-open clause written about
   the evidence rather than about the fork, a label whose lead-in qualifies the
   phrase, as in `**Open decision (guardrail-bound):**`, and dual option
   enumerations such as `**Option A ...**` / `**Option B ...**` bullets or
   `(a) ... (b) ...`. The same substance contract — a labeled open-decision
   lead-in, including that qualified form — supersedes any literal-only
   `"Open decision:"` written/surfacing wording in
   `tests/task_create/evals/evals.json`, `tests/task_create/evals/README.md`, and
   `tests/task_create/README.md`, so `grade.sh` and those harness prose surfaces
   stay lockstep. The label-presence check still reports zero labels for a body
   that surfaces no decision at all, so widening it costs no detection. A local
   run under `tests/task_create/evals/workspace/` may illustrate those forms; it
   is never the Acceptance proof source.
7. After the grader changes, a `--vendor cursor` run of the task-family evals
   (per `TESTING.md`) yields a per-eval per-behaviour pass/fail summary, and that
   summary is committed at
   `tests/task/results/grader_authoring_discipline.md`. The file names each
   eval, which behaviours passed and which failed, and for every still-failing
   behaviour records its reason rather than dropping it from the set. The file
   is the deliverable; a gitignored `results/run-*.md` or `results/run-*.json`
   report is not.
