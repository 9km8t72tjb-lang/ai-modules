# Grader-authoring discipline — task-family Cursor eval summary

Vendor: `cursor` (`agent -p`, model `auto`).
Run directory: `tests/task/evals/workspace/run-20261004-222734`.
Command: `python3 tests/task/evals/run.py --vendor cursor`.
Overall: **18/43** evals fully green; **291** behaviours passed, **25** behaviours failed.

Per-eval per-behaviour results from each eval's `grading.txt`.
Every still-failing behaviour keeps its reason rather than dropping
from the set. Concurrent edits under the host `tasks/` tree during
this run caused many isolation checks to fail; those are recorded
below as failed behaviours with that reason.
