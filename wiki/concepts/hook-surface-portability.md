# Hook surface portability

## Definition

A hook is a policy that runs at a point in the agent's lifecycle, usually before
or after a tool call. Among the five harnesses whose hook contracts the research
here has worked out, Claude, Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode, and Copilot in VS
Code, no two agree on the configuration format, the event payload, or the way a
handler says no. Cursor is the one target left whose surface is unworked here,
which is unfinished coverage rather than a support decision.

The portable design that follows from that is one shared executable policy script
called from per-harness configuration, with the script itself written to detect
which harness invoked it.

## Current state of knowledge

### Four configuration schemas, plus one that is code

Claude and Codex both nest event names under a top-level `hooks` key, but their
schemas, event coverage, matcher names, trust model, and command environment
differ enough that the two configuration files stay separate.

Copilot in VS Code shares that top-level `hooks` key and then diverges on the one
level that matters. Claude and Codex fill the event array with **matcher groups**,
each group carrying its own nested `hooks` array. Copilot fills it with the hook
objects directly and documents no `matcher` field at all. The two shapes are close
enough to look interchangeable and far enough apart that a Claude file dropped
into a Copilot hook directory parses as valid JSON and then fails item validation,
because a matcher group carries no `command`. Near-miss compatibility is worse
than none, because it defers the failure to load time and hides it in a log.

Antigravity is a fourth declarative slot rather than a variant of any of them. Its
file is keyed by a named hook first and the event second, and it can sit loose in
a workspace or global directory or be bundled inside its plugin package.

OpenCode has no declarative hook configuration at all. A hook there is a
JavaScript or TypeScript plugin run by the embedded Bun runtime, which makes it a
different review and trust proposition from a Markdown or JSON component.

A four-harness plugin therefore ships four hook configurations over one shared
script, and reaches OpenCode through a thin bridge plugin that builds the
script's stdin envelope, runs it, and throws on a non-zero exit.

How this repository lays those files out, and where its deploy routes each one,
is on [hook delivery design](hook-delivery-design.md).

### Four signalling contracts

This is the part a shared script gets wrong most easily. Claude and Codex block
by exit code over a snake_case envelope. Copilot also sends a snake_case envelope
on stdin and also treats exit 2 as a block, which makes it the closest thing to a
free target for a script already written for Claude; its considered decision is a
`permissionDecision` of `allow`, `deny`, or `ask` nested under
`hookSpecificOutput`, and it is fail-closed on `PreToolUse`, so a crash denies the
call. Antigravity reads a camelCase envelope and expects a JSON `decision` on
stdout. OpenCode blocks by throwing inside the plugin.

A script that only ever exits non-zero therefore fails open silently on
Antigravity. Matching event names make this worse rather than better: Antigravity
uses Claude's event names while implementing none of Claude's behaviour, so a
`PreToolUse` hook that works under Claude parses the wrong field names and exits
into a handler that wanted a decision value. The event name matching is a reason
to check the envelope, not a reason to skip the check.

A portable script parses the envelope by the field names the invoking harness
actually sends, and branches its response shape the same way. It reads event
input from stdin when available, tolerates missing or extra fields, detects the
harness through documented environment variables, and resolves the plugin root
from an environment variable with a script-relative fallback.

### Layers are additive, so duplicates are the normal failure

Codex loads hooks from user configuration, project configuration, managed
configuration, and enabled plugins, and a higher-precedence layer does not
replace a lower one. All matching hooks run. The same command present in a plugin
hook and a user hook produces duplicate reviews and duplicate execution.

Diagnose a surprising hook count by enumerating active sources before touching
any script: the plugin manifest hook path, the plugin root hook file, user and
project files, inline tables, managed policy, the installed plugin cache, and the
review interface. A displayed count can reflect separate sources, separate
matcher groups, parse errors beside valid hooks, or stale cached plugin files.

### Guarantees differ by harness

A hook's guarantee is only as strong as its interception point. On OpenCode,
`tool.execute.before` does not intercept tool calls made by task-tool subagents,
so a before-hook guard is bypassable by delegation and gives a weaker guarantee
than the same guard on Claude or Codex. Its `permission.ask` hook is defined but
never fired, so interception has to use the before hook regardless.

Where a harness offers a declarative permission model, that model can cover
simple path protection without a hook at all, but it cannot express conditional
logic such as a branch check.

### Runtime loading is verified before shipping

Confirm a target actually loads plugin-bundled hooks before shipping a blocking
or lifecycle hook inside a plugin, and document the trust, enablement, or reload
step that makes it active. On Codex a non-managed command hook is listed but
skipped until the user reviews and trusts the current definition, and an edit
requires review again. On Claude a plugin component change needs a reload or
restart.

## Open questions

Two coverage decisions are unsettled. Whether an OpenCode bridge is worth its
experimental dependency is open work. And Cursor is now the only target whose
hook contract is unworked here, which is what stops the shared script claiming a
uniform guarantee across every tree it lands in; its deploy branch matches on a
Cursor-named configuration file that nobody has been able to write.

One question the Copilot research raised is settled rather than open. Both Copilot
products read `~/.claude/settings.json` for hooks, so a Claude hook merged there
would fire in VS Code too, and shipping both that merge and a Copilot-native file
would run the same guard twice in one session. The decision that settles it is
recorded on [hook delivery design](hook-delivery-design.md).
