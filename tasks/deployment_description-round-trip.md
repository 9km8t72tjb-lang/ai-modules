# Carry the source description through every deploy generator unchanged

## Goal

Every deploy generator that rebuilds frontmatter writes the source's
`description` so that the target harness reads exactly the text the source
declares, whichever YAML scalar form the source uses: plain, single-quoted,
double-quoted, or a `>` or `|` block scalar. The deploy harness proves this round
trip for each generator and each form, so a generator change that alters a
description fails a test.

## Context

The deploy script copies skills verbatim, and it rewrites agent frontmatter for
VS Code, Cursor, and Claude through `rewrite_agent_frontmatter`, which passes the
description lines through and so preserves every form. Four generators rebuild
frontmatter key by key instead, each reading `description` with its own
single-line pattern. On 7 October 2026 a probe ran each of them on fixture sources
and compared what a parser reads from the output with the source:

| Generator | Quoted value | Block scalar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generate_opencode_agent` | kept, reads correctly | description lost |
| `generate_antigravity_agent` | kept, reads correctly | description lost |
| `generate_cursor_style_rule` | quotes stripped, so a value holding a colon followed by a space no longer parses | description lost |
| `generate_toml_agent` (Codex) | quote characters become part of the TOML string | description becomes `>` or `\|` |

A plain value survives all four. The block-scalar loss comes from the line loops:
`generate_opencode_agent` and `generate_antigravity_agent` skip the indented lines
after a key, which leaves an empty `description: >`, while
`generate_cursor_style_rule` and `generate_toml_agent` capture only the key line.

`escape_toml_basic_string` escapes `\` and `"` only. `generate_toml_agent` uses it
for the single-line basic strings (`name`, `description`, `model`,
`model_reasoning_effort`) and for the multi-line `developer_instructions` string,
where raw newlines are legal.

The deploy script runs on a runtime floor of Bash 3.2, `jq`, `perl`, and `rsync`,
so decoding has to happen in shell or perl. The tests can use Python: `tomllib`
(Python 3.11 or newer) reads the Codex output, and the frontmatter check that
[the frontmatter gate task](toolchain_frontmatter-yaml-gate.md) adds prints each
file's decoded top-level values as JSON through its `--values` mode, which reads a
fixture source and a generated YAML file alike. This task uses that mode, so it
lands after the gate task.

The forms to support are the scalar forms the frontmatter check accepts: plain,
single-quoted (an embedded `'` written as `''`), double-quoted with backslash
escapes, and `|` or `>` block scalars with an optional `-` or `+` chomping
indicator.

## Approach

The generators in scope are those that rebuild frontmatter rather than copy it:
the four in the Context table, plus any such generator that has landed since.

**YAML targets.** In `generate_opencode_agent`, `generate_antigravity_agent`, and
`generate_cursor_style_rule`, carry the source's `description` entry through as
written: the key line as it stands, quotes included, followed by the indented
continuation lines of a block scalar. Remove the quote stripping from
`generate_cursor_style_rule`.

**Codex.** In `generate_toml_agent`, decode the YAML scalar into its text before
encoding it, in shell or perl: undo the quoting of a single- or double-quoted
value, and for a block scalar join the continuation lines by the literal or
folded rule with the chomping indicator applied. Write the result as a
single-line TOML basic string that escapes newlines and other control characters
as well as `\` and `"`. `developer_instructions` keeps its multi-line string and
its current escaping.

**Harness.** Add a round-trip script beside `style_run.sh` under
`tests/deployment/script_tests/`, run from `tests/deployment/run_all.sh`. It stages
fixture agent and style sources in a temporary directory, one per scalar form,
with values that exercise each form's escaping: a colon followed by a space and a
`#` after whitespace in every form that allows them, an embedded quote in the
quoted forms, a backslash, and more than one line in the block scalars. It calls
each generator in scope by sourcing the deploy script with
`DEPLOYMENT_SH_SKIP_MAIN=1`, the way `style_run.sh` calls `merge_json_key`, and
runs `rewrite_agent_frontmatter` on the same fixtures so the passthrough path
stays covered. For each output it compares the description a parser reads with
the one the source declares, reading YAML through the frontmatter check's
`--values` mode and the Codex TOML through `tomllib`.

**Out of scope:**

- Other frontmatter keys the generators carry, such as `name`, `model`, and
  `tools`, which hold identifiers and plain values today.

## Acceptance

- The round-trip script runs from `tests/deployment/run_all.sh` and passes,
  comparing every generator in scope and `rewrite_agent_frontmatter` against every
  scalar form.
- The harness includes a negative control that feeds the comparison a
  description with its quotes stripped, and the comparison reports that mismatch.
- The Cursor style rule generated from a double-quoted description that contains a
  colon followed by a space parses, and its description reads as the source text.
- The Codex TOML generated from a single-quoted and from a double-quoted
  description reads through `tomllib` as the source text, with no quote
  characters the text itself lacks.
- A `>` and a `|` block-scalar description reach the OpenCode, Antigravity, Cursor
  style rule, and Codex outputs with their full text, folded or kept literal as
  the indicator requires.
- `tomllib` reads the `developer_instructions` of a generated Codex agent as the
  source body.
